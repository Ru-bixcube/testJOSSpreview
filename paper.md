# Summary

Advances in highly multiplexed tissue imaging are transforming our understanding of human biology by enabling measurement of 10-100 proteins at subcellular resolution [@Bodenmiller:2016]. Efforts are now underway to create public atlases of multiplex images of normal and diseased tissues [@Rozenblatt-Rosen:2020]. Both research and clinical applications of tissue imaging benefit from recoding data from as large a specimen as possible so that data on cell state and composition can be investigated in the context of overall tissue architecture. As a practical matter, specimen size is limited by the dimensions of microscopy slides (2.5 x 7.5 cm or ~2-8 cm<sup>2</sup> of tissue depending on shape. With current technology, specimens of this size can be imaged at sub-micron resolution across ~60 spectral channels and ~10^6 cells, resulting in images terabytes size. The rich detail and multi-scale properties of these images poses a substantial compuational challenge [@Rashid:2020].

In this paper we described a new open-source visualization tool, Minerva, which faciliates intuitive real-time exploration of large multiplexed images on the web. Minerva employs the OpenSeadragon [@OpenSeagradon] framework to render images at multiple resolutions and makes it possible to pan and zoom across across images in a process analogous to Google Maps. However, tissues contain many specialized structures recognizable by pathologists and histologists but not by many other scientific or medical users. To make use of specialied expertise we require software that mimics the current practice in which a pathologists sits alongside a colleague and reviews a specimen by moving from point to point and switching between high and low magnifications.

Minerva is designed to generate precisely these types of interactive guides or "stories". The author of a story creates specific waypoints in the image each with a text description, position, zoom level, and overlaid shape annotations. In the case of highly multiplexed images, a subset of channels are chosen for display (typically 4-8 superimposed channels). Authors also add interactive single-cell data scatterplots, bar charts, heatmaps, and cell outlines with two-way linked navigation between the plots and points in the image. Minerva is deployed simply and inexpensively via static web hosting. 

Minerva is not designed to solve all of analytical and visualization problems encountered in mutliplex tissue imaging. Instead, it is a publication tool specialized to the task of making data shareable and broadly intelligible without requiring specialized software on the user side. As such, Minerva is designed to be one component in an ecosystem of interoperable, open-source sofware tools.

![Minerva Workflow.\label{fig:figure}](figure.pdf)

Minerva comprises two components, _Minerva Story_ and _Minerva Author_. _Minerva Story_ is a single-page web application for presenting an image and its narrative to end users. OpenSeadragon[@OpenSeagradon] is used to render tiled JPEG image pyramids overlaid with the author's narrative text, graphical annotations and data plots. Audio presentation of the narrative text is optionally provided through integration with Amazon's Polly text-to-speech service. The image pyramid URL and all narrative details are loaded from an independent YAML story definition file. _Minerva Story_ is deployed via the Jekyll [@Jekyll] static site generator which allows users to integrate multiple stories and accompanying content into a simple website and host it through GitHub Pages or any other web host supporting static content such as Amazon S3.

_Minerva Author_ is a desktop application for constructing narratives (stories) for _Minerva Story_. It is a JavaScript React web application with a Python Flask backend, packaged with PyInstaller as a native application. To create a narrative, the author first imports an image in OME-TIFF pyramid or SVS format. Both RGB images (brightfield, H&E, immunohistochemistry, etc.) and multi-channel fluorescence images (immunofluorescence, CODEX, CyCIF, etc.) are supported. Fluorescence image rendering can be controlled through per-channel contrast adjustment and pseudocoloring. The author then adds one or more story waypoints. For each waypoint, the author can type a text description, draw polygon or arrow annotations to highlight specific cells, regions, and histological features, and choose specific image channels to present. After the waypoints are complete, Minerva Author renders the input image into one or more RGB JPEG image pyramids and produces a YAML story definition file. The author finally uploads the JPEG images (vastly smaller than the raw image data) and YAML file to a web host along with the HTML files produced by Jekyll to produce a browsable Minerva Story instance. Story waypoints can be also augmented with interactive linked data visualizations. Adding data visualization currently requires manually editing the YAML file but a future version of Minerva Author is in development for adding these types of visualizations natively.

Minerva offers two approaches to exploring a narrative. First, in the author-driven approach, users can progress through a story in a linear path using forward and back navigation buttons, allowing an efficient introduction to and expert overview of the data. Second, in a free-epxloration approach, the user is free to move to any position or zoom level and select any channel grouping or segmentation mask. Users can also take a hybrid approach by follwing a story and then departing from it to freely explore or skip between waypoints. By returing to a story waypoint the narrated overview can be resumed, much like as one follows an audioguide in a museum. Minerva supports creating deep links directly to any position and zoom level in an image simply by copying and sharing the current URL from the browser. Users can optionally write a text note and draw a custom shape annotation that is automatically presented to the recipients.

We have already found many applications for Minerva: visualizing cell-type classifiers in image space, validating results of unsupervised clustering of single-cell data, manual scanning for spatial patterns, assessing quality of antibody staining, obtaining second opinions from collaborators, sharing high-resolution primary image data alongside published manuscripts, and creating educational content for medical trainees. Minerva is also being used by national consortia to build tumor atlases, and we anticipate that it will also be added to widely used genome browsers such as cBioPortal [@Cerami:2012] to facilitaite joint exporation of genomic and histological data.
